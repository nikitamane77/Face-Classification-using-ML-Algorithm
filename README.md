Comparative approach of Machine learning models to find out best model. Analyzed and retrieved data from web URL using power BI. Thereafter cleaned, modelled, and visualized that data with Power BI.

Objective
• To carry out preprocessing tasks such as decreasing picture data size, eliminating garbage values, resizing photos and converting them to model format.
• Tunning model using grid search cv and using wavelet transforms for feature engineering.
• Detecting the face and eyes using the OpenCV library
• A comparison analysis of SVM, logistic regression, and random forests is performed and the model that performs best is chosen for this study.
